== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin automatically calculate the shipping costs and display this in the checkout to the customer? =

No, the plugin does not interfere with the checkout process at all. The plugin's primary function is to easily create a shipment at Brenger from an order in your
WooCommerce store.
